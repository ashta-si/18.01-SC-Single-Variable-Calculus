# 18.01-SC-Single-Variable-Calculus


## Syllabus

This syllabus provides an overview of the MIT Single Variable Calculus course (18.01SC) as designed for independent study through OpenCourseWare. Here's a breakdown of the key information:

**Prerequisites:** High school algebra and trigonometry. Prior calculus experience is helpful but not required.

**Course Content:** The course covers the foundational topics of single-variable calculus, including:
* **Differentiation:** Rules, applications to graphing, rates, and optimization.
* **Integration:** Definite and indefinite integrals, the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.
* **Applications:** Area, volume, arc length, average values, work, and probability.
* **Advanced Topics:** Techniques of integration, L’Hôspital’s Rule, improper integrals, and infinite series (including Taylor series).

**Learning Goals:** Upon completion, students are expected to:
* Understand the core concepts of derivatives as rates of change and integrals as sums.
* Be proficient in a range of calculus skills, such as using differentiation rules, sketching graphs, solving max/min and related rates problems, evaluating integrals, and determining the convergence of improper integrals and infinite series.

**Course Structure:** The material is divided into five main units, each with multiple parts and sessions. The units are:
1.  Differentiation
2.  Applications of Differentiation
3.  The Definite Integral and its Applications
4.  Techniques of Integration
5.  Exploring the Infinite

The course is self-contained and designed for independent study. It includes lecture videos, recitation videos, written notes, worked examples, problem sets, and exams with solutions. An estimated 150 hours is needed to complete the course, with a significant portion of that time dedicated to problem-solving. No textbook is required.
